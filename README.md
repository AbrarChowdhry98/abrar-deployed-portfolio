# Abrar-deployed-portfolio
As an open and approachable person who loves to engage with others both in person and virtually, I find myself always drawn to anything to do with technology and computers. As a self starter who loves being part of a team as well, I bring discipline and rigor from my years of collaboration through different positions. This, in addition to my numerous diplomas in digital art, technology, animation, and now coding, have helped me reach my present position where I hope to develop websites, both large and small. Ease of transition, smooth and appealing visuals that help deliver a client's vision in a concise and timely manner are my goals. Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
